This file details the installation process of putting Ubuntu 12.04 on the VIA EPIA P800 and P900-100 PICO ITX SBCs.
Because the PICOs do not come with disc drives, they are built to default to attempt to boot over a network by default.
You will have to set up a small network and system to provide the necessary net boot configuration for the PICO to successfully
access the network the install.

You'll need
- The PICO (SBC)
- A Linux computer (PC)
- A router
- 3 ethernet cables

Setup the network
- Wire the SBC and PC to the router and the router to the internet.  The PC should be able to access the internet.

Setup the router
- The router is expected to currently setup in a standard configuration.
- Make sure the rotuer has a static IP address (make note of it)
- Disable the DHCP server on the router (the PC will be the DHCP server)

Setup the PC
- The PC needs to be setup to run a DHCP server (use the same subnet as the static IP the router has)
--- See http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/478 for possible solutions, I've used the dnsmasq option
- The PC should be given a static IP address (on the same subnet)
- The PC should set its default gateway to the router's IP address
- The PC should set its DNS server to Google's DNS (8.8.8.8)

Setup the netboot installation for Ubuntu.
- Make sure you have tftpd-hpa to provide a PXE netboot
--- I've used as a reference http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/install-configure-tftp-server-ubuntu-debian-howto/

Boot the SBC
- Turn on the SBC, it should attempt and get an IP address from the PC DHCP server
- It should should successfully find the PXE netboot image on the PC

Install Ubuntu
- Start normal installation
- After you set up the domain name for the board and it configures the network and asks for a country to find packages, wait
- Push ctrl alt f2 to get to a shell
- Change the gateway for the SBC
--- `route -n`
--- `route del default`
--- `route add default gw [PUT ROUTER IP HERE]`
- You should be able to ping the internet now by IP address if teh gateway works
--- `ping 8.8.8.8`
- You should be able to ping domain names if the DNS is working on the PC
--- `ping www.google.com`
- Continue installation
--- It may spend a long time (~30min) on a purple screen after checking the us.archive.ubuntu.com
- Finish installation
- It will tell you you can reboot

Setup configuration
- Turn off netboot priority
--- On boot on BIOS screen, push delete to get to the BIOS menu
--- Change boot order to prefer HD
--- Save and quit
- In BIOS set the APM to Power ON after AC power loss
--- If you don't the board may not restart on power. If that happens, you will need to short PW_BN- and GND (pins 5 and 6) in CN4 to simulate a power button press
- It will reboot
- Log on to Ubuntu
- Enable root account
--- `root passwd`
- Disable GRUB block on boot
